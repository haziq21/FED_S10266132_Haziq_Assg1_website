# Submission for FED Assignment 1

This is a Spotify clone. Spotify's users are people who want to listen to various genres of music at home and on the go. This repo contains a prototype that shows the homepage, album page, and video player page on mobile (the video player displays on the homepage on desktop).

See the design on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/design/hsGh7RcB387Kdhdtj9OjKT/FED_S10266132_Haziq_Assg1_wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=ABxW5Cfc1GZcqZzL-1).

## Development notes

As much as possible, the CSS uses the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology to organise styles. The JavaScript is used to control the song player timeline (with pausing/playing and manual adjustment of the elapsed time) (in `timeline.js`), as well as animations for the video player (in `script.js`).

## Attributions

The website design was adapted from Spotify on desktop and mobile. All fonts (Inter) and icon SVGs were taken from Google Fonts.
